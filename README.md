===========

pdf catalog gives your users a pdf catalog of your entire opencart store or just the category. 
This is for a small scale store where any given category is less that 150-200 products, however pdf catalog has preformed on upto 600 items.
if you use "all categories" or do not display categories then your total product count must be less than the above mentioned, this is a limit based on the timeout  your hosting provider has configured generally ~30 sec.
